> A journey into learning about magnetic strip data in modern day cards

#### WORK IN PROGRESS
**Hardware:** [Deftun MSR90 3 Track Reader](https://www.amazon.com/MSR90-Magnetic-Credit-Reader-Deftun/dp/B01DUB4GVO/)

I will be documenting all my research on magnetic strip data aswell at writing code for it.
For some reason it seems hard to find code  or any valid documentation on working with magnetic strip data on Linux, so this will attempt to be a deep dive into understanding the capabilities.
