## Information
This repository serves as a personal exploration of magnetic stripe data as used in modern payment systems. The focus is on understanding the formatting of magnetic strip data, the mechanics of how systems interpret this data, and the associated security risks and vulnerabilities.

Despite the widespread use of magnetic stripe technology in financial transactions, there is a notable scarcity of accessible information and practical code examples on this topic.

Let's hope we don't get Banned ðŸ¤·

###### Initial discover & observances
To my suprise, most of these card readers act as an HID that mimics a keyboard. Simply put, you swipe a card and it types the data out that is on the magnetic strip. Also to my suprise these work out of the box on Linux & Android systems.

## Financial Cards

There are up to three tracks on magnetic cards known as tracks 1, 2, and 3. Track 3 is virtually unused by the major worldwide networks, and often is not even physically present on the card by virtue of a narrower magnetic stripe. Point-of-sale card readers almost always read track 1, or track 2, and sometimes both, in case one track is unreadable. The minimum cardholder account information needed to complete a transaction is present on both tracks. Track 1 has a higher bit density *(210 bits per inch vs. 75)*, is the only track that may contain alphabetic text, and hence is the only track that contains the cardholder's name. 

### Track 1
Track 1 is written with code known as DEC SIXBIT plus odd parity.

###### Format C-M
Reserved for use by ANSI Subcommittee X3B10

###### Format N-Z
Available for use by individual card issuers

### Track 2
This format was developed by the banking industry *(ABA)*. This track is written with a 5-bit scheme *(4 data bits + 1 parity)*, which allows for 16 possible characters, which are the numbers 0â€“9, plus the six characters  : ; < = > ? . *(ASCII range 0x30 through 0x3f)*

| ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Start sentinel                      | 1 byte *(the ; character)*   |
| Primary account number (PAN)        | up to 19 characters *(may contain spaces sometimes)* |

| Expiration date                     | four characters in the form YYMM. |
| Service code                        | three digits. The first digit specifies the interchange rules, the second specifies authorization processing and the third specifies the range of services |
| Discretionary data                  | as in track one |
| End sentinel                        | one character (generally '?') |
| Longitudinal redundancy check (LRC) | it is one character and a validity character calculated from other data on the track. Most reader devices do not make the LRC available for display, but use it to verify the input internally to the device. |
