## Information
This repository serves as a personal exploration of magnetic stripe data as used in modern payment systems. The focus is on understanding the formatting of magnetic strip data, the mechanics of how systems interpret this data, and the associated security risks and vulnerabilities.

Despite the widespread use of magnetic stripe technology in financial transactions, there is a notable scarcity of accessible information and practical code examples on this topic.

Let's hope we don't get Banned ðŸ¤·

###### Initial discover & observances
To my suprise, most of these card readers act as an HID that mimics a keyboard. Simply put, you swipe a card and it types the data out that is on the magnetic strip. Also to my suprise these work out of the box on Linux & Android systems.

## Financial Cards
These follow the ISO/IEC 7813 standard which define the properties of financial transaction cards.

### Track 1
![](./.screens/track1.png)

Track 1 is written with code known as DEC SIXBIT plus odd parity.

It can contain up to 79 characters.

Most bank cards are using format B

###### Additional un-common formats
| Format | Description                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| A      | Reserved for proprietary use of the card issuer |
| C-M    | Reserved for use by ANSI Subcommittee X3B10     |
| N-Z    | Available for use by individual card issuers    |

###### Example data
```
%B4815881002867896^YATES/EUGENE JOHN         ^37829821000123456789?
%B4815881002861896^YATES/EUGENE L            ^^^356858      00998000000? 
```

### Track 2
![](./.screens/track2.png)

It can contain up to 40 characters.

### Track 3
![](./.screens/track3.png)

It can contain up to 107 characters *(same density as track 1 but has the same character encoding as track 2)*

Most cards do not even use a 3rd track, and is mostly un-used worldwide.
